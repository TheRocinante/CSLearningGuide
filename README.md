### CS Learning Guide

The purpose of this repo is to provide a beginner's roadmap to learn programming and computer science fundamentals. The author does not claim to be an authoritative figure on either subject, and so pull-requests are welcome.

### Introduction

The computer science landscape is vast. There are myriad resources on starting your CS journey. A college degree obviously comes to mind, which is certainly overkill, especially if you've already completed coursework in some other engineering field.

### Objectives

This is a self-study guide aimed for anyone who's a self-starter, those who could be described by the principal, "Learn and Be Curious", which I'm shamelessly stealing from Amazon's leadership principles.

One concrete goal is to provide enough "quality" knowledge to prepare a student for a software-related career. Companies cannot find new-hires fast enough. But this project is not on behalf of any commercial interest. The goal is to help you, the reader, build a knowledge base *so you have the toolkit and preparation to pursue a software career*.

We'll attempt to provide a balance between practical, hands-on application vs. computer science theory. The goal is not to churn out programmers but a software development *engineer*, a person with the ability to think critically, solve real-world problems, and continuously learn and improve their skill set. This isn't necessarily the same as Amazon, Google, or {insert company here}'s definition, and that's fine.

### Syllabus

This section defines a grouped breakdown of topics, similar to your college course syllabus. These items should be studied at your own pace. To set yourself up for success, the main criteria is consistency. The reader should dedicate some time each week to reading and practicing these topics.
